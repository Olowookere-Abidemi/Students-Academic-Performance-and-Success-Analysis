# Students-Academic-Performance-and-Success-Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize the factors influencing students' academic performance and success. The dataset provided insights into various aspects, such as financial status, accommodation type, study hours, and more.  

## Data Oveerview: 

- The analysis used a dataset sourced from Kaggle.
- The dataset contained: 145 rows and 32 columns.
- Detailed attributes for student demographics, academic performance, financial information, and other variables.

## Data Preparation and Profiling

_**Data Profiling**_

- Reviewed column descriptions and attribute distributions to understand the dataset comprehensively.
- Used the dataset dictionary to decode numerical values into meaningful labels.

_**Data Cleaning**_

- Removed blanks and duplicate rows in Excel to maintain data quality.
- Used Excel's replace function to map numeric codes (1, 2, 3, 4) to descriptive labels per the dataset dictionary.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The analysis was conducted using:

- **Excel:** For initial data profiling and preparation.
- **Microsoft Power BI:** To create interactive dashboards and visualizations, presenting insights concisely.

## Key Insights

- Accommodation: Most students live in rental housing (68), followed by dormitories (49). Fewer students stay with family (27) or other arrangements (1).
- Transportation: A majority (98) commute by bus. Others use private cars/taxis (25) or bicycles (1).
- Financial Status: Most students fall in the $135–$200 financial bracket (93), with fewer in higher income ranges.
- Scholarships: 76 students receive 50% scholarships. 42 students receive 75%, while 23 receive full scholarships. Only 1 student gets no scholarship.
- Study Hours: Less than 5 hours of study per week is common (51 students—23 female, 28 male). Only 4 students study for more than 20 hours.
- Relationship Status and CGPA: Students not in relationships generally have higher GPAs, particularly above 3.0.
- Age Group: The majority (70 students) are aged 22–25,Others fall between 18–21 years (65) or above 25 years (10).
- Grades: The most common grades are DD and DC, with few achieving higher grades like AA or BB.
- High School Type: Most students graduated from state high schools.
- Parental Status: The majority of students' parents are married.

## Recommendations

- Accommodation Support: Offer housing subsidies or support for students in rental housing to ease financial stress.
- Transportation Facilities: Improve transportation options, especially focusing on making bus travel more affordable and efficient.
- Financial Aid: Expand full scholarship opportunities or increase aid for students in lower financial brackets.
- Study Hours: Promote better study habits through workshops, study groups, or online academic resources.
- Relationship Awareness Programs: Provide sessions on balancing personal relationships with academics to improve performance.
- Grade Improvement: Offer academic support programs targeting students with common grades like DD and DC.
- Diversity Support: Address the needs of students in different age groups and financial brackets through tailored resources.
- High School Partnerships: Strengthen ties with state high schools to support student preparation for higher education.

## Outcome:

This project successfully identified key factors influencing students' academic success and provided actionable recommendations for improvement. By leveraging Excel and Power BI, I presented data-driven insights to support decision-making in academic settings. The project also highlights the importance of targeted interventions in housing, transportation, financial aid, and academic support to create an environment conducive to student success.
